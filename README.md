### Welcome!

Hello, my name is Jackson Strauss and I am currently a rising sophomore mechanical engineering student at Washington University in St. Louis.

I sometimes like to code in my free time and so I'll upload those projects here. I have also uploaded some documentation (not source code) for certain projects that I think would be interesting to others and so that I can showcase my skills. 

I don't really work on any public projects on GitHub and so all of the things that I'm uploading are either personal projects or work that I've completed myself while being on a team or club. You can go to my repositories to see some of the stuff I've worked on.
